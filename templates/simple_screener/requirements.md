Goal = {create the n8n workflow that will perform next: Simplified search for top U.S. companies from potential sectors},

Steps for sectors search = {
First, we conduct a search for 5 potential sectors that will meet the following criteria:
Strategic importance:
The sector has fundamental importance for the technological sovereignty, economic growth, and national security of the U.S.
It is in the focus of government policy and corporate strategies (for example, de-risking, government support, investment programs).
Demand and supply:
There is explosive and irreversible demand for the sector’s products or services.
Supply is inelastic, and there are barriers to entry for new competitors.
Innovativeness and technological maturity:
Explain at what stage of development the sector is (emerging, growth, or maturity).
Does it have innovation, a large number of patents, startups, and R&D activity?
Geopolitical context:
Find whether the sector provides a strategic advantage for the U.S. over other countries (for example, China or the EU).
It is important in global supply chains.
Risks and resilience:
Check what key risks exist for the sector (dependence on raw materials, political risks, technological failures). },

Role for sectors search = { You have in-depth knowledge of strategic management (using frameworks such as PESTLE, SWOT, Porter), geopolitics and international relations (analysis of techno-nationalism, sanctions policy, supply chains), and macroeconomics and market theory (analysis of techno-nationalism, sanctions policy, supply chains). You also have specialized knowledge in deconstructing and recombining frameworks for customized criteria, assessing the net effect of geopolitical risks (sanctions) and support (subsidies), and identifying sectors with “economic rent” (high demand + inelastic supply).},

Steps for companies search = {And within the potential sectors we find candidates that will meet the following criteria:
Taking into account the sector analysis, create a ranking of companies within the most promising U.S. sectors identified earlier, which are not yet recognized by other market participants, whose trend is only emerging or at an early stage of development, and which will address the following questions:
Company selection
Find public companies with the highest potential, that have strong reasons to be leaders in the sector and the greatest chance of being leaders in the sector.
Select the top 3 companies from each sector.
Evaluation criteria
Financial metrics: revenue, free cash flow (FCF), moderate level of debt.
Innovativeness: technologies, R&D, patents, new products.
Management: experience, strategic decisions, ability to execute plans.
Risks: debt burden, dependence on suppliers, regulatory risks.
(Preferable) Institutional investors: whether there are large funds among shareholders.
Comparison
Present the results as a concise overview with comparison tables (multiples, growth rates, innovativeness).
For each sector, provide a short conclusion: which company is the best and why.
Time horizon and scenarios
Investment horizon: 2–5 years.
Add scenario analysis for each company: optimistic, base, pessimistic.},

Role for companies search = {You have in-depth knowledge of corporate finance (fundamental analysis, analysis of financial statements (Income Statement, Balance Sheet, Cash Flow)), valuation of intangible assets (analysis of R&D, patents, assessment of management quality and strategy execution), and Equity Research practice (screening, financial modeling (DCF, Comps), writing a “stock pitch”). You also have specialized knowledge with a focus on quality (FCF) versus accounting profit (EPS), assessment of the quality of capital allocation, and building clear, actionable comparative matrices for decision-making.},

Required outcome = {a list of top companies from potential sectors, up to 15 companies}.
